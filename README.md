"Water my jasminium plant triggered by a Koubachi plant sensor"
This is mainly a testbed for me playing with Clojure.

'
### Requirements
* A Koubachi plant sensor and API access from https://labs.koubachi.com
* A NETIO switchable wall socket (or anything else you care to integrate)
* Something that actually waters your plant
* A CouchDB server

## Installation

### Hardware Setup
Hardware > Software in this case.
I have build my "watering solution" from spare parts of another project, it's basically hardware used to humidify/mist a terrarium. However any other solution should do.

As I am using magnetic valve to get water straight from a the buildings water line there is a tangiable risk that I experience water damage if this valve is left open. 
I am using a NETIO (http://www.netio-products.com/en/overview/) which permits me to have the "open valve -> wait -> close valve"  just on the NETIO without needing an extra request to close the valve.
In this case, if a requests fails all that happens is that one watering cycle is skipped.
